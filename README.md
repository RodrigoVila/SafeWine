# SafeWine: Bottle anti-counterfeiting system

## Description

More than 20% of the world's wine is counterfeit, causing consumers to lose confidence in important brands.
Through blockchain technology, SafeWine offers the possibility of creating a single immutable record for each bottle produced, restoring cellars and consumers confidence.

## How?

Every time a bottle is created, a Non Fungible Token (NFT) with an associated QR Code is generated. This token can be transferred to a new owner, or it can be sold invalidating it.

## Technologies involved:

* React JS
* Typescript
* Solidity
* Truffle
* Ganache
* Web3
